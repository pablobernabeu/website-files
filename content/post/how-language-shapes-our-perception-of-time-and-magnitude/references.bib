	abstract = {The temporal-focus hypothesis claims that whether people conceptualize the past or the future as in front of them depends on their cultural attitudes toward time; such conceptualizations can be independent from the space–time metaphors expressed through language. In this paper, we study how Chinese people conceptualize time on the sagittal axis to find out the respective influences of language and culture on mental space–time mappings. An examination of Mandarin speakers' co-speech gestures shows that some Chinese spontaneously perform past-in-front/future-at-back (besides future-in-front/past-at-back) gestures, especially when gestures are accompanying past-in-front/future-at-back space–time metaphors (Exp. 1). Using a temporal performance task, the study confirms that Chinese can conceptualize the future as behind and the past as in front of them, and that such space–time mappings are affected by the different expressions of Mandarin space–time metaphors (Exp. 2). Additionally, a survey on cultural attitudes toward time shows that Chinese tend to focus slightly more on the future than on the past (Exp. 3). Within the Chinese sample, we did not find evidence for the effect of participants' cultural temporal attitudes on space–time mappings, but a cross-cultural comparison of space–time mappings between Chinese, Moroccans, and Spaniards provides strong support for the temporal-focus hypothesis. Furthermore, the results of Exp. 2 are replicated even after controlling for factors such as cultural temporal attitudes and age (Exp. 3), which implies that linguistic sagittal temporal metaphors can indeed influence Mandarin speakers' space–time mappings. The findings not only contribute to a better understanding of Chinese people's sagittal temporal orientation, but also have additional implications for theories on the mental space–time mappings and the relationship between language and thought.},

Dynamic models appear to be quasi-universal cross-culturally, as does the generalization that in Ego-reference-point models, FUTURE IS IN FRONT OF EGO and PAST IS IN BACK OF EGO. The Aymara language instead has a major static model of time wherein FUTURE IS BEHIND EGO and PAST IS IN FRONT OF EGO; linguistic and gestural data give strong confirmation of this unusual culture-specific cognitive pattern. Gestural data provide crucial information unavailable to purely linguistic analysis, suggesting that when investigating conceptual systems both forms of expression should be analyzed complementarily. Important issues in embodied cognition are raised: how fully shared are bodily grounded motivations for universal cognitive patterns, what makes a rare pattern emerge, and what are the cultural entailments of such patterns?

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Syntactic templates serve as schemas, allowing speakers to describe complex events in a systematic fashion. Motion events have long served as a prime example of how different languages favor different syntactic frames, in turn biasing their speakers toward different event conceptualizations. However, there is also variability in how motion events are syntactically framed within languages. Here, we measure the consistency in event encoding in two languages, Spanish and Swedish. We test a dominant account in the literature, namely that variability within a language can be explained by specific properties of the events. This event-properties account predicts that descriptions of one and the same event should be consistent within a language, even in languages where there is overall variability in the use of syntactic frames. Spanish and Swedish speakers ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 84) described 32 caused motion events. While the most frequent syntactic framing in each language was as expected based on typology (Spanish: verb-framed, Swedish: satellite-framed, cf. Talmy, {\textless}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90"{\textgreater}2000{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}), Swedish descriptions were substantially more consistent than Spanish descriptions. Swedish speakers almost invariably encoded all events with a single syntactic frame and systematically conveyed manner of motion. Spanish descriptions, in contrast, varied much more regarding syntactic framing and expression of manner. Crucially, variability in Spanish descriptions was not mainly a function of differences between events, as predicted by the event-properties account. Rather, Spanish variability in syntactic framing was driven by speaker biases. A similar picture arose for whether Spanish descriptions expressed manner information or not: Even after accounting for the effect of syntactic choice, a large portion of the variance in Spanish manner encoding remained attributable to differences among speakers. The results show that consistency in motion event encoding starkly differs across languages: Some languages (like Swedish) bias their speakers toward a particular linguistic event schema much more than others (like Spanish). Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the typology of event framing, theories on the relationship between language and thought, and speech planning. In addition, the tools employed here to quantify variability can be applied to other domains of language.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Yet, experimental evidence has reopened debate about the extent to which language influences nonlinguistic cognition, particularly in the domain of time. In this article, I will first analyze an influential argument against the Whorfian hypothesis and show that its anti-Whorfian conclusion is in part an artifact of conflating two distinct questions: Do we think in language? and Does language shape thought? Next, I will discuss crosslinguistic differences in spatial metaphors for time and describe experiments that demonstrate corresponding differences in nonlinguistic mental representations. Finally, I will sketch a simple learning mechanism by which some linguistic relativity effects appear to arise. Although people may not think in language, speakers of different languages develop distinctive conceptual repertoires as a consequence of ordinary and presumably universal neural and cognitive processes.},

We used retrospective confidence ratings to objectively measure metacognition in a mental rotation task in three culturally different regions: the Middle East (Saudi Arabia), Western Europe (Portugal) and the Far East (China). Our data support the theory that metacognition is social in nature, at least to some extent, and is influenced by culture. Differences in metacognition between societies can be accounted for by cultural values pertaining to individualism and uncertainty avoidance. Lower individualism and greater uncertainty avoidance tend to be associated with higher metacognitive abilities. Sex-based differences typically observed in mental rotation do not emerge at the metacognitive level, with both males and females in all three societies efficiently detecting those responses when they are more likely to make a mistake. Metacognitive bias—the tendency to be over- or underconfident in one’s own decisions—might be modulated by cultural differences in the masculinity cultural dimension. However, this bias seems to be independent of metacognitive sensitivity and detecting decisions with a heightened likelihood of an error.},

	abstract = {Abstract Linguistic relativity is the influence of language on other realms of cognition. For instance, the way movement is expressed in a person’s native language may influence how they perceive movement. Motion event encoding (MEE) is usually framed as a typological dichotomy. Path-in-verb languages tend to encode path information within the verb (e.g., ‘leave’), whereas manner-in-verb languages encode manner (e.g., ‘jump’). The results of MEE-based linguistic relativity experiments range from no effect to effects on verbal and nonverbal cognition. Seeking a more definitive conclusion, we propose linguistic and experimental enhancements. First, we examine state-of-the-art typology, suggesting how a recent MEE classification across twenty languages (Verkerk, 2014) may enable more powerful analyses. Second, we review procedural challenges such as the influence of verbal thought and second-guessing in experiments. To tackle these challenges, we propose distinguishing verbal and nonverbal subgroups, and having enough filler items. Finally we exemplify this in an experimental design.},

Contrary to English, German number words comprise decade–unit inversion (e.g., vierundzwanzig is literally translated as four-and-twenty). To investigate the mental representation of numbers, we tested the effect of visual and linguistic–morphological characteristics on the development of verbal–visual transcoding. In a longitudinal cross-linguistic design, response times (RTs) in a number-matching experiment were analyzed in Grade 2 (119 German-speaking and 179 English-speaking children) and in Grade 3 (131 German-speaking and 160 English-speaking children). To test for long-term effects, the same experiment was given to 38 German-speaking and 42 English-speaking adults. Participants needed to decide whether a spoken number matched a subsequent visual Arabic number. Systematic variation of digits in the nonmatching distractors allowed comparison of three different transcoding accounts (lexicalization, visual, and linguistic–morphological). German speakers were generally slower in rejecting inverted number distractors than English speakers. Across age groups, German speakers were more distracted by Arabic numbers that included the correct unit digit, whereas English speakers showed stronger distraction when the correct decade digit was included. These RT patterns reflect differences in number–word morphology. The individual cost of rejecting an inverted distractor (inversion effect) predicted arithmetic skills in German-speaking second-graders only. The moderate relationship between the efficiency to identify a matching number and arithmetic performance could be observed cross-linguistically in all age groups but was not significant in German-speaking adults. Thus, findings provide consistent evidence of a persistent impact of number–word structure on number processing, whereas the relationship with arithmetic performance was particularly pronounced in young children.},

Exploratory analyses indicated that individuals’ time management habits, temporal distance, and event order in written scenarios were related to time spatialisations.

In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of "universal," we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.

We tested the relationship between the structure of number-words (inverted “Units-Decades (UD) format” or not “Decades-Units (DU) format”) and performance on the digit span task for recalling two-digit number-words presented verbally, using two modes of output. University students, native speakers of Arabic, who were also highly proficient in Hebrew, and native speakers of Hebrew, were asked to response by typing Arabic digits or recalling numbers verbally. Arabic and Hebrew speakers were equal in WMc for one-digit numbers in the two modes. However, when inversion was presented, performance was related to output and participants habits. In the typing response, both groups showed better performance for the DU format. In the native language (standard format), Arabic speakers (UD) remembered fewer numbers than Hebrew speakers (DU). Arabic speakers show inversion errors even in the noninverted format. For verbal responses, there were no differences between the groups in their standard format, and native speakers of Arabic weren’t affected by the format, while Hebrew speakers still preferred the DU format. Experience with inverted and noninverted language affected WMc but is also related to the output demands.},

	abstract = {Some number-naming systems are less transparent than others. For example, in Dutch, 49 is named “negenenveertig,” which translates to “nine and forty,” i.e., the unit is named first, followed by the decade. This is known as the “inversion property,” where the morpho-syntactic representation of the number name is incongruent with its written Arabic form. Number word inversion can hamper children’s developing mathematical skills. But little is known about its effects on adults’ numeracy, the underlying mechanism, and how a person’s bilingual background influences its effects. In the present study, Dutch-English bilingual adults performed an audiovisual matching task, where they heard a number word and simultaneously saw two-digit Arabic symbols and had to determine whether these matched in quantity. We experimentally manipulated the morpho-syntactic structure of the number words to alter their phonological (dis)similarities and numerical congruency with the target Arabic two-digit number. Results showed that morpho-syntactic (in)congruency differentially influenced quantity match and non-match decisions. Although participants were faster when hearing traditional non-transparent Dutch number names, they made more accurate decisions when hearing artificial, but morpho-syntactically transparent number words. This pattern was partly influenced by the participants’ bilingual background, i.e., their L2 proficiency in English, which involves more transparent number names. Our findings suggest that, within inversion number-naming systems, multiple associations are formed between two-digit Arabic symbols and number names, which can influence adults’ numerical cognition.},

	abstract = {Research on multi-digit number processing suggests that, in Arabic numerals, their place-value magnitude is automatically activated, whenever a magnitude-relevant task was employed. However, so far, it is unknown, whether place-value is also activated when the target task is magnitude-irrelevant. The current study examines this question using the parity congruency effect in two-digit numbers: It describes that responding to decade-digit parity congruent numbers (e.g., 35, 46; same parity of decades and units) is faster than to decade-digit parity incongruent numbers (e.g., 25; 36; different parities of decades and units). Here we investigate the (a-) symmetry of the parity congruency effect; i.e. whether it makes a difference whether participants are assessing the parity of the unit digit or the decade digit. We elaborate, how and why such an asymmetry is related to place-value processing, because the parity of the unit digit only interferes with the parity of the decade digit, while the parity of the decade digit interferes with both the parity of the unit digit and the integrated parity of the whole two-digit number. We observed a significantly larger parity congruency effect in the decade parity decision than in the unit parity decision. This suggests that automatic place-value processing also takes place in a typical parity judgment task, in which magnitude is irrelevant. Finally, because of the cross-lingual design of the study, we can show that these results and their implications were language-independent.},

	abstract = {The role of grammar in numerical development, and particularly the role of grammatical number inflection, has already been well-documented in toddlerhood. It is unclear, however, whether the influence of grammatical language structure further extends to more complex later stages of numerical development. Here, we addressed this question by exploiting differences between Polish, which has a complex grammatical number paradigm, leading to a partially inconsistent mapping between numerical quantities and grammatical number, and German, which has a comparatively easy verbal paradigm: 151 Polish-speaking and 123 German-speaking kindergarten children were tested using a symbolic numerical comparison task. Additionally, counting skills (Give-a-Number and count-list), and mapping between non-symbolic (dot sets) and symbolic representations of numbers, as well as working memory (Corsi blocks and Digit span) were assessed. Based on the Give-a-Number and mapping tasks, the children were divided into subset-knowers, CP-knowers-non-mappers, and CP-knowers-mappers. Linguistic background was related to performance in several ways: Polish-speaking children expectedly progressed to the CP-knowers stage later than German children, despite comparable non-numerical capabilities, and even after this stage was achieved, they fared worse in the numerical comparison task. There were also meaningful differences in spatial-numerical mapping between the Polish and German groups. Our findings are in line with the theory that grammatical number paradigms influence. the development of representations and processing of numbers, not only at the stage of acquiring the meaning of the first number-words but at later stages as well, when dealing with symbolic numbers.},

However, it is an open question whether inversion of decades and units also influences number processing beyond the two-digit number range. The current study addresses this question by investigating compatibility effects in both German- (a language with inverted) and English-speaking (a language with non-inverted number words) university students (mean age 22 years) in a three-digit number comparison task. We observed reliable hundred-decade as well as hundred-unit compatibility effects for three-digit number comparison. This indicates that, comparable two-digit numbers, three-digit numbers are processed in a parallel decomposed fashion. However, in contrast to previous results on two-digit numbers as well as on children’s processing of three-digit numbers, no reliable modulation of these compatibility effects through language was observed in adults. The present data indicate that inversion-related differences in multi-digit number processing are limited. They seem to be restricted to the number range involving those digits being inverted (i.e., tens and units in two-digit numbers) but do not generalize to neighboring digits. Possible reasons for this lack of generalization are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

He referred to three different types of speech: “external speech,” “private,” and “inner speech.” It has been observed that the left inferior frontal gyrus represents the brain area sustaining inner speech use. In bilinguals it has been observed that the private speech can be either one, depending on the specific context. However, languages acquired later in life are less likely to be used for inner (emotional) speech compared to early acquired languages and L1 is preferred for emotional inner speech even when this language is partly attrited. When performing calculation tasks bilinguals seem to use L1 more frequently as the inner speech for mental calculations. The use of L2 is also reported for mental mathematics, particularly in cases in which education has been received in the second language. It has been suggested that bilinguals develop memory networks for calculations that are specific for each language based in specific brain networks.},

One of the most central questions in linguistics and cognitive psychology is whether language influences human cognition, which has been investigated in various domains such as color, space, and number. Recently, some researchers investigated the influence of language on the processing of conceptual metaphors, such as space–pitch metaphor and space–time metaphor. In this selective review, we first present the background of the linguistic relativity hypothesis, the Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and the relationship between bilingualism, conceptual metaphor, and embodiment. Then, we focus on space–time metaphor, a type of conceptual metaphor to depict the impact of bilinguals’ spatial language on their mental representation of time. Despite the mixed evidence in the literature, most of the current findings supported the linguistic relativity hypothesis that spatial language does have an impact on bilinguals’ mental representation of time. We conclude by providing a tentative answer to the effect of linguistic relativity on conceptual metaphor processing and bringing up some questions that will lead to future research.},

An overview of the published findings suggests that, like the classic monolingual general findings, bilingual retrieval is enhanced by such factors as deep processing, elaboration, distinctiveness, and spaced practice repetitions, as opposed to shallow processing and massed repetitions. Moreover, there is a propensity for between-language conditions (i.e., translations) to enhance memory retrieval, relative to within-language conditions (i.e., monolingual conditions), suggesting that translations are more distinctive and require more mental effort and mental elaboration. Bilingual memory retrieval appears to be language-dependent, and retention is enhanced to the extent to which the retrieval contextual properties (i.e., language) and processes (i.e., perceptual vs. semantic) match those employed during the encoding process. Bilingual memory effects are related to existing bilingual models, and methodological and empirical concerns are discussed and underscored.},

In abnormal aging, such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease or stroke, these changes in language use and abilities become highly variable and often more extreme than in normal aging. They need to be carefully considered in clinical assessments and treatment.

The proposed framework is composed of four steps that encourages practitioners to: (1) assess their client’s behavioral and linguistic acculturation; (2) assess their clients’ verbal language abilities in both languages; (3) determine potential issues with comparing their clients’ cognitive abilities with the normative samples of available tests; and (4) select most appropriate test given the client’s sociocultural/behavioral background, language abilities, and appropriateness of available tests.

While the literature exploring the intersection of psychopathology and bilingualism is scant, there is evidence of differential symptomology observed across languages spoken. The two main areas of research discussed focus on the dynamics of L2 acquisition and psychopathology, and the barriers that speaking an L2 can impose on the process of assessing and diagnosing mental illness.

By integrating representational accounts of cognition with accounts of online processing, this framework provides a unifying perspective that highlights important relationships between seemingly disparate factors that impact upon a bilingual’s performance and developmental history. It will be shown that the two phenomena under discussion, when set in a context that includes the mind as a whole can be most satisfactorily explained as examples of the operation of general principles of cognition as well as of principles that are specifically linguistic.},

	abstract = {Bilinguals can present language disorders not completely equivalent in their first (L1) and second (L2) languages. In this chapter five neuropsychological conditions that can potentially be linguistically dissociated in bilinguals will be examined: aphasia, alexia, dysphasia, dyslexia, and dementia. In bilingual individuals, aphasia is usually observed in both languages, although the specific aphasia clinical manifestations can be different. The aphasia profile (i.e., type of aphasia) and severity, as well as the pattern of recovery, are not necessarily coincidental in L1 and L2. Alexia can be dissociated across different writing systems, across two phonological systems; and even within the same Latin writing system. In children presenting a specific language acquisition impairment the defect will affect any language the child is exposed to. However, bilingual children are rarely equivalently exposed to each language. Developmental dyslexia can have specific manifestations in each of the languages in bilingual children. These differences are related to the characteristics of the orthographic system, particularly, its transparency or opacity. It is assumed that in bilingual individuals, regression to a primary language may be associated with the development of cognitive impairment and increased risk for the development of dementia.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, researchers have noted consistent costs in lexical access among bilingual participants. Using a variety of fluency measures, but primarily picture-naming with switching, bilinguals are often outperformed by their monolingual peers. Bilingual deficits on fluency measures are observed across the lifespan, though recent findings would argue that deficits are more likely the result of differences according to language proficiency, balanced bilingualism, and everyday switching frequency. Furthermore, these deficits are surprisingly met with bilingual advantages in other tasks measuring executive control processes, such as the Simon, Stroop, and flanker task, which are thought to tap into inhibition and conflict monitoring abilities. The current chapter outlines these findings, as well as the current debate surrounding the bilingual advantage: a hypothesized account for everyday language-switching leading to stronger executive function, as measured with behavioral and neuroimaging methods. Inconsistencies across these methods have led to greater urgency for more rigorous experimental control, additional statistical analyses, and new behavioral tasks.},

It starts with reviewing different types of figurative language and the importance it has for revealing the mechanisms underlying language processing in general. As research into how bilinguals process figurative language is largely an extension of the research questions explored in the monolingual literature, the chapter next discusses models developed to account for how native language (L1) speakers store and process figurative language. The chapter then summarizes the still limited studies into L2 (nonnative) and bilingual figurative processing and identifies major research themes that have been explored through off-line and online behavioral, electrophysiological, and eye-tracking studies which looked at how nonnative language users acquire, store, and retrieve different figurative tropes.},
