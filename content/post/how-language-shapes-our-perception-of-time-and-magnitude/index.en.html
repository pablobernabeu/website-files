summary: "Explore the profound influence of language on our perception and organisation of abstract concepts like time and numerical magnitude. We will challenge the intuitive belief in universal understanding, revealing how linguistic structures subtly but significantly shape cognitive processes. For time, the post highlights diverse spatial metaphors: English often uses horizontal mapping (past behind, future ahead), while Mandarin Chinese employs both horizontal and vertical terms. The Aymara language uniquely positions the future behind and the past in front. Importantly, reading and writing direction can also influence temporal representation, sometimes even overriding linguistic metaphors. Regarding numbers, language structure impacts mathematical reasoning. German's inverted number structure (e.g., 'four-and-twenty') causes cognitive interference, especially for children, reflected in slower responses. However, this influence is limited, particularly in adults. Overall, while language significantly impacts cognition, it acts flexibly, interacting with other cognitive and environmental factors rather than imposing rigid constraints. The post concludes by emphasizing the critical need for cognitive science to embrace broader linguistic diversity to avoid English-centric biases and fully understand the human mind."

<p>The relationship between language and how humans perceive and organise the world, particularly concepts such as time and magnitude, is a topic that has attracted considerable scholarly attention. While some evidence supports the role of language in shaping these cognitive patterns, the findings also reveal significant nuances and a multifaceted interaction with other factors. This exploration will delve into these complexities, demonstrating that the influence of language is not always straightforward and is mediated by a variety of linguistic and extralinguistic elements.</p>
<div id="time-a-flexible-construct" class="section level2">
<h2>Time: A Flexible Construct</h2>
<p>Recent research has extensively investigated how language influences human cognition, specifically concerning the mental representation of time. The linguistic relativity hypothesis suggests that spatial language affects how bilingual individuals mentally represent time [1,2]. For example, studies have suggested that thinking about time relies on representations of concrete concepts like space, which are derived from direct sensorimotor experience. This means that people’s thinking and understanding of the abstract concept of time are largely dependent on the more concrete concept of space, even in tasks that do not involve language. Studies have suggested that when individuals speak different linguistic metaphors, they tend to think about target concepts differently. For instance, Dutch speakers often refer to musical pitches using height metaphors (high/low), whereas Farsi speakers use thickness metaphors (thin/thick). Experiments using non-linguistic pitch reproduction tasks revealed that Dutch speakers incorporated height information while Farsi speakers incorporated thickness information, demonstrating distinct mental representations of abstract concepts influenced by linguistic metaphors. Furthermore, training Dutch speakers to describe pitches using thickness metaphors, similar to Farsi speakers, resulted in a comparable pattern of thickness interference, suggesting a causal link between language and musical pitch estimation. Even prelinguistic 4-month-old infants show sensitivity to both height-pitch and thickness-pitch metaphoric associations, which suggests that language may build on pre-existing mappings that can be strengthened or weakened.</p>
<p>While some contradictory findings exist (e.g., Chen, 2007; January &amp; Kako, 2007; Tse &amp; Altarriba, 2008), the overall evidence suggests that language significantly impacts how time is represented, providing support for the linguistic relativity hypothesis. However, this impact is part of a complex interplay with other cognitive and cultural factors, rather than a rigid determination of thought.</p>

<h2>Numbers: The Language of Quantity</h2>
<p>Beyond time, language also shapes how we perceive and process numerical magnitude. Different languages structure number words in ways that affect mathematical reasoning. If you had learned maths in a different language, do you think that today you would solve problems differently? A recent study explored how linguistic structures influence numerical cognition by comparing speakers of German and English. The researchers examined whether differences in number word structure affected how speakers processed and manipulated numerical information. German—like Dutch, Slovenian and some other languages—uses an inverted number structure for two-digit numbers—for example, 42 is spoken as ‘two and forty’ rather than ‘forty-two’. English, by contrast, follows a more straightforward order. The study found that German speakers—especially children—were more likely to experience cognitive interference when processing two-digit numbers due to the inversion. This interference was reflected in slower responses during the exercise. However, this influence appears to have limitations, particularly in adults, as no consistent language effects were found for three-digit number processing in German and English-speaking adults. This suggests that language influences on multi-digit number processing in children cannot simply be generalized to adults and may be specific to stimulus sets, age groups and tasks.</p>

<div id="bilingualism-and-broader-cognitive-impacts" class="section level2">
<h2>Bilingualism and Broader Cognitive Impacts</h2>
<p>The experience of speaking more than one language, while enriching, also introduces unique cognitive dynamics. While the idea of a ‘bilingual advantage’ in executive functions (e.g., stronger cognitive control) has been debated, some consistent cognitive costs in lexical access have been noted for bilingual individuals. These can include a smaller vocabulary in each language, more interference on lexical decision tasks, an increased number of ‘tip-of-the-tongue’ experiences (difficulty retrieving a word despite knowing its meaning), and slower performance on picture-naming tasks compared to monolinguals. These deficits are often explained by the need for bilinguals to manage multiple lexicons, leading to weaker links between words and concepts within each language or by continuous cross-linguistic competition.</p>
<p>However, the debate regarding a ‘bilingual advantage’ in executive processing is complex, with some scholars arguing against its widespread existence due to methodological issues such as researcher biases, small sample sizes and potential publication bias (Paap, 2014). Factors like the age of second language acquisition, proficiency levels and the frequency of language switching can significantly influence these findings. Future research calls for more longitudinal designs and rigorous control of participant variables to
clarify these inconsistencies.</p>
<p>In early proficient simultaneous bilinguals, the processing of emotion words appears identical in both languages. However, emotional dissociations are more likely to be observed in late sequential non-proficient bilinguals. The emotional advantage for the native language observed in sequential late bilinguals has been attributed to a delay in cognition-emotion coupling in the second language. Furthermore, the processing of emotional information in a second language may differ qualitatively and quantitatively from that in the native language. While some suggest the age of acquisition as the predominant factor, others propose frequency of use or the context of language acquisition. Mediating factors also include types of experimental tasks, language proficiency and language dominance. Research also points to the need for high linguistic competence and cultural understanding to fully comprehend emotion concepts, such as humor, in a second language. Future research should investigate the impact of distance between languages, differences in orthographic systems, and strategies used in recall processes.</p>
<p>Bilingualism also affects personality traits and cognitive abilities. Different personality profiles may emerge when personality inventories are administered in the first and second languages. This suggests that the profile of abilities is not coincidental across languages, which has crucial consequences for education and the understanding of cognition in bilingual and multilingual individuals. Bicultural individuals may exhibit cultural frame switching, adapting their values and attributions based on culture-relevant stimuli. This phenomenon, which is similar to code-switching in language, implies high levels of linguistic and cultural proficiency. Studies have suggested that multicultural teenagers born abroad who settled in London during childhood scored higher on Open-Mindedness and Cultural Empathy, but lower on Emotional Stability, compared to those born and raised in London. Language experience, particularly multi-dominance, also influences personality profiles, supporting the idea that personality is shaped by social factors such as multiculturalism and language dominance. However, the question of whether personality traits are modulated by language remains unsettled and controversial, requiring larger samples and control for cultural and linguistic factors.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of inner speech in bilinguals can involve either the first or second language, depending on various factors, such as the context in which a specific mathematical ability was learned. Research on bilingual episodic memory suggests that like monolingual findings, retrieval in bilinguals is enhanced by deep processing, elaboration, distinctiveness and spaced practice repetitions, as opposed to shallow processing and massed repetitions. Moreover, there is a propensity for between-language conditions, such as translations, to enhance memory retrieval relative to within-language conditions, suggesting that translations are more distinctive and require more mental effort and elaboration. However, the lack of consistency in measuring language proficiency and dominance remains a pressing issue in bilingual research, highlighting the need for more objective assessment tools. Studies have suggested language-dependent memory effects, where retrieval is significantly better if the language of study or encoding matches the language of retrieval. This general finding holds for balanced bilinguals in both Spanish and English. Even more impressively, memories learned in one language or country may be better remembered if tested in that language. This suggests that language context can guide memory access, contrasting with cases where memories from one language background are remembered in another language, even if the original language is not used. Transfer appropriate processing is also a valuable paradigm for investigating bilingual memory, by ensuring language is held constant during both encoding and retrieval.</p>

<h2>Other Cognitive Domains Influenced by Language</h2>
<p>Beyond time and magnitude, linguistic characteristics of English, being the dominant language in cognitive science research, can inadvertently bias research programs and lead to overgeneralizations about human cognition. English is only one of around 7,000 distinct languages globally, and it differs significantly from most others in its forms, vocabulary, grammar and usage rules. This reliance on English speakers risks warping research by overemphasising features present in English and overgeneralising findings from English speakers to the entire human species. For example, in pitch perception, Farsi and Turkish speakers, unlike English speakers, do not consistently show high-low space-pitch mappings in non-linguistic tasks, as their languages do not use such metaphors. This highlights how the assumed ‘universal’ nature of concepts can be an artefact of English-centric research.</p>
<p>The vocabulary of English partitions meaning in specific ways. For instance, it has few distinctions for olfaction compared to languages that encode myriads. The absence of specific words in a language can lead to vague representations outside of language. English also tends to highlight manner in events, making this semantic dimension more memorable for its speakers, while other languages may prioritize path information.</p>
<p>Grammatical structures also play a role. English uses a relative, viewpoint-dependent frame of reference (e.g., ‘left/right’), while many other languages use an absolute frame (e.g., cardinal directions). This difference affects spatial cognition, memory and even the learning of dance routines. Similarly, the internal structure of phrases affects working memory; English speakers tend to recall the last elements of a list better (‘recency effect’), while speakers of languages like Japanese, where heads of phrases appear at the end, often show a ‘primacy effect’ (better recall for earlier elements). Languages also differ in how they package information into verbs, leading to different ways of conceptualising and segmenting events in non-linguistic cognition. Mastery of complement clauses in English is linked to better performance in false-belief tasks, suggesting language structure can bolster Theory of Mind.</p>
<p>Even conversational norms, such as those described by Gricean maxims of efficiency, are partly mediated by language and culture. Speakers of languages other than English in Africa and East Asia, for example, often use ambiguous, indirect and opaque utterances, suggesting that Gricean expectations might not be universally applicable. This highlights that English conversational conventions are not necessarily universal, with other cultures showing different back-channeling practices and expressions of gratitude.</p>
<p>Psychopathology and bilingualism is another area of intersection. Second language acquisition impacts cognitive, emotional and behavioral domains, potentially influencing the expression of psychopathology-related symptoms across languages. This can lead to differential symptomology observed across languages, for example, more symptoms experienced in the first language versus the second or vice versa. However, much of the literature exploring this relationship suffers from methodological and theoretical shortcomings, primarily relying on case studies with small sample sizes, making it difficult to establish causality. Research suggests that different personality profiles can be found when personality inventories are administered in the first and second languages. While bilinguals may report differences in affect between their two languages, with the first language often described as more emotional, experimental results are inconsistent. In early simultaneous proficient bilinguals, emotion word processing is identical in both languages, whereas emotional dissociations are more likely in late sequential non-proficient bilinguals.</p>

<div id="future-directions" class="section level2">
<h2>Future Directions</h2>
<p>To fully understand the representational and computational capacities of the human mind, cognitive science must embrace a broader range of linguistic diversity beyond English. Future research should aim to control for confounding influences, such as socioeconomic differences across countries, using robust statistical methods. It is also crucial to account for interindividual variation by considering each speaker’s baseline biases in their language(s) and other cognitive domains.</p>
<p>Further, researchers ought to explore intraregional differences, such as variations between closely related languages, to scrutinise the scope of linguistic influence beyond coarse dichotomies. For instance, Quechua features space-time metaphors similar to, but not identical with, those of Aymara, raising questions about whether these differences translate into cognitive distinctions. Methodologically, this field needs to utilise diverse approaches, including larger quantitative studies of spontaneous gestures and investigate the ‘entrenchment’ of linguistic patterns within a language, as low consistency might reduce the power to detect relativity effects. Finally, fostering equitable collaborations between researchers from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds is vital for expanding the scope of cognitive science.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, language exerts a profound yet flexible influence on how we perceive and organise abstract concepts like time and numerical magnitude. While linguistic patterns can shape our thought processes, cognitive flexibility allows individuals to adapt their thinking across contexts. These findings underscore that language interacts dynamically with other cognitive and environmental factors rather than imposing rigid constraints on the mind. By continuing to explore these intricate connections, especially across the vast spectrum of global linguistic diversity, we can gain invaluable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of human cognition.</p>
