<p>Longitudinal studies consist of several sessions, and often involve session session conductors. To facilitate the planning, registration and tracking of sessions, a session logbook becomes even more necessary than usual. To this end, an Excel workbook with conditional formatting can help automatise some formats and visualise the progress.</p>
<p>Below is an example that is <a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AouK9kQQrXKooGKVLbdBzz-DStmj?e=mbNZE4">available on OneDrive</a>. To fully access this workbook, it may be downloaded via <kbd>File</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Save as</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Download a copy</kbd>. Alternatively, the workbook can be exported to one’s own account on OneDrive.</p>
<p>The conditional formats include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fill in blanks in columns A, C or D to remove the background</p></li>
<li><p>fill in blanks in F and G, or I and J, or L and M, etc, to highlight the entire session in green</p></li>
<li><p>fill in any notes columns to highlight them in red</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These conditional formats can be consulted (and edited) from the <kbd>Home</kbd> tab by opening <kbd>Conditional Formatting</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Manage Rules</kbd>. At the top, the option <kbd>This Worksheet</kbd> should be selected to view all formulas.</p>
