### The present script can be used to pre-process data from a frequency list of the Norwegian as Web Corpus (NoWaC).

Before using the script, the frequency list should be downloaded from https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/about/organization/text-laboratory/services/nowac-frequency.html. The list is described as 'frequency list sorted primary alphabetic and secondary by frequency within each character', and the direct URL is: https://www.tekstlab.uio.no/nowac/download/nowac-1.1.lemma.frek.sort_alf_frek.txt.gz. The download requires signing in to an institutional network. Last, the downloaded file should be unzipped.
