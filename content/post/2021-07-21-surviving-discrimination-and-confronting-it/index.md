This blog post does not provide a complete overview of the atmosphere at university or in academia.
</div>

<br>

There is a lot of discrimination at European universities and in the corresponding academia. Minorities are too often oppressed and abused through the use of casual remarks, concerted attacks, unequal respect towards different groups, unfair hiring decisions, and other negligent behaviours. Professional and personal negligence is the reason why this discrimination is tolerated and condoned by staff of higher authority. 

The disappointing situations above listed would be unsurprising in some big-money industries. At university, on the contrary, they are striking---first, because there are mechanisms to tackle and resolve them (however rigged they will be sometimes); second, because the other conditions of the job---notably, the salary---do not compensate for the negligence in the social sphere.


## *Homo homini lupus*

Xenophobia is one of the types of discrimination that sometimes crop up in halls of residence, departments, panels, committees, offices. Xenophobia exists where you are now, as it does where you come from. It is intrinsic to human societies (see Hinton, 2017). Who doesn't know the way different nationalities are ranked in specific places? The specifics of these hierarchies vary across regions and individuals (thank goodness); and yet, xenophobia always tends to be underlain by an unfair, puny spirit.

### Hierarchies among nationalities

The locals tend to be first. Through many everyday tricks, the locals often ensure that immigrants remain second to them. We must all remember that more people should not mean more rights. Each person is a person.

The first rank of immigrants is formed of one or two nationalities, smiled at by the fortune of historical or cultural ties. The second rank of immigrants is that of merely-tolerated nationalities. The third rank is formed of immigrants who are despised due to historical, political, cultural factors.

Sadly and dangerously enough, in competitive or onerous circumstances (*when is that not the case, though!*), *homo homini lupus*. Discrimination breaks loose (Abbink, & Harris, 2019; Meiring et al., 2014; Mendes & Koslov, 2013). Ominous, historical references are unnecessary. A hundred, or a few hundred, years is very little time: it's *yesterday*.


## Policies

Policy statements are increasingly popular, and they give reasons for hope. For instance, the employment webpage of Duke University reads (on 21st July 2021; https://hr.duke.edu/policies/diversity/eeo):

> Duke University prohibits discrimination and harassment, and provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an individual's age, color, disability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.

Such statements, if indeed observed by the employees, constitute historical---why, historic!---changes. They should be celebrated, applauded---even if they simply adhere to fundamental, human rights.


## Dealing with discrimination

Discrimination takes many forms. Accordingly, surviving and confronting it requires various approaches. Stoicism, bravery, protection and ingenuity are all valuable against the xenophobia that lurks, and occasionally bites, in halls of residence, informal meetings, committees, offices, and decisions at universities across Europe. Inspiration for such approaches can be found in many places---even in popular literature. For instance, Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* contains a passage in which a lawyer is mobbed by nostalgic townspeople who do not want a Black citizen to be treated as a human. The strategies for the defence from the lynch mob span from the lawyer's stoicism to his son's adolescent bravery, and from the invisible protection by an armed ally to the bewitching ingenuity of the lawyer's eight-year-old daughter. 


### Collection and presentation of evidence

To begin confronting, reporting, and warding off discrimination, it helps to safely store all possible documentary evidence of such discrimination. In the best scenario, that is not necessary. Unfortunately, sometimes it is. In that case, it is important to ensure the safe collection and storage of the evidence, as it may have to be presented to the relevant mediators or authorities. 

When a case has to go ahead, it is convenient to produce an extensive document that describes in detail every relevant episode and the corresponding evidence, which may be attached. Don't fret about *reading time*: the larger the document, the better.

Name it! Discrimination has precise names---for instance, *xenophobia*---, which must be used where relevant and necessary. People know the meaning: perpetrators are likely know it, and so will the authorities or mediators who are in charge of resolving the case. Whether these people like the word to be used or not is their own problem, not yours. Nonetheless, names are just that---labels. Another label for many common cases at university is 'unfairness'. It is less specific but often more objective.


### Ceaseless awareness

Lobbying, whether we like it or not, is one of the necessary ways to confront this plight. So, talk about it. If you are sick and tired of discrimination, make sure that other potential targets of it know that it is not fair; that they should not have to put up with it.

#### The internet 

The creation of awareness does not have to fully depend on close relationships. Email and social media allow safe activity where anonymity is necessary.


## Take-home message

If you have suffered discrimination, or you are a potential target for it, please ensure that you are aware of this plague÷. Regardless of the rank that is lent to types of discrimination such as xenophobia in social agendas (be that fair or wise, or very much otherwise), it must never be tolerated by the people who suffer or witness it. Discrimination breaches human and fundamental rights, national laws and institutional rules.

If you are not a target but you think it is humane to act as an ally against discrimination, please try to confront it if you witness it, and to contribute to a widespread awareness.
