This blog post does not provide a complete overview of the atmosphere at university or in academia, where I think that fairness is far more common than discrimination. Let's keep up the good work, and be mindful of the rest.
</div>

<br>

There is discrimination at European universities and in the corresponding academia. Minorities are too often oppressed and abused through the use of casual remarks, concerted attacks, unequal respect towards different groups, unfair hiring decisions, and other negligent behaviours. Professional and personal negligence is the reason why this discrimination is tolerated and condoned by staff of higher authority. Cases of discrimination are not normally shared by the universities, but they are sometimes registered on the websites of student unions, other student forums, or in the press.

Discrimination cases would be unsurprising in some big-money industries. At university, on the contrary, they are striking---first, because there are mechanisms to tackle and resolve them (however rigged they will be sometimes); second, because the other conditions of the job---notably, the salary---do not compensate for the negligence in the social sphere (even if there are many applicants for a single post in academia).


## *Homo homini lupus*

Xenophobia is one of the types of discrimination that sometimes crop up in halls of residence, departments, panels, committees, offices. Xenophobia exists where you are now, as it does where you come from. It is intrinsic to human societies (see Hinton, 2017). In society at large, who doesn't know the way in which different nationalities are ranked in a certain place? The specifics of these hierarchies vary across regions and individuals (thank goodness); and yet, xenophobia always tends to be underlain by an unfair, puny spirit.


### Hierarchies among nationalities

In society at large, the locals tend to be first. Through many everyday tricks, the locals often ensure that immigrants remain second to them. We must all remember that more people should not mean more rights. Each person is a person.

The first rank of immigrants is formed of one or two nationalities, smiled at by the fortune of historical or cultural ties. The second rank of immigrants is that of merely-tolerated nationalities. The third rank is formed of immigrants who are despised due to historical, political, cultural factors.

Sadly and dangerously enough, in competitive or onerous circumstances (*when is that not the case, though!*), *homo homini lupus est* (people are wolves unto others). Discrimination breaks loose (Abbink, & Harris, 2019; Meiring et al., 2014; Mendes & Koslov, 2013). Ominous, historical references are unnecessary. A hundred, or few hundred, years is very little time: it's *yesterday*.


## Policies

Policy statements are increasingly popular, and they give reasons for hope. For instance, the employment webpage of Duke University reads (on 21st July 2021; https://hr.duke.edu/policies/diversity/eeo):

> Duke University prohibits discrimination and harassment, and provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an individual's age, color, disability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.

Such statements, if indeed observed by the employees, constitute historical---why, historic!---changes. They should be celebrated, applauded---even if they simply adhere to fundamental, human rights.


## Dealing with discrimination

Discrimination takes many forms. Accordingly, surviving and confronting it requires various approaches. Stoicism, bravery, protection and ingenuity are all valuable against the xenophobia that lurks, and occasionally bites, in halls of residence, informal meetings, committees, offices, and decisions at universities across Europe. Inspiration for such approaches can be found in many places---even in popular literature. For instance, Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* contains a passage in which a lawyer is mobbed by nostalgic townspeople who do not want a Black citizen to be treated as a human. The strategies for the defence from the lynch mob span from the lawyer's stoicism to his son's adolescent bravery, and from the invisible protection by an ally to the disarming ingenuity of the lawyer's eight-year-old daughter, who finds one of her neighbours in the mob.


### Collection and presentation of evidence

Ironically, complaint cases are sometimes initiated by those who have exerted discrimination. If you receive a complaint and you feel you have been discriminated against before or through the complaint, it is important to note this in your response. 

The discrimination can be well described by means of an extensive document that recounts every relevant episode, with the applicable evidence being attached. Don't fret about *reading time*: the larger the document, the better.

Name it! Discrimination has precise names---for instance, *xenophobia*---, which must be used where relevant and necessary. People know the meaning: perpetrators are likely know it, and so will the authorities or mediators who are in charge of resolving the case. Whether these people like the word to be used or not is their own problem, not yours. Nonetheless, names are just that---labels. Another label for many common cases at university is 'unfairness'. It is less specific but often more objective.


### Ceaseless awareness

Lobbying, whether we like it or not, is one of the necessary ways to confront this plight. So, talk about it. Make sure that other potential targets of it know that it is not fair, that they should not have to put up with it, and that they might be able to confront it in one way or another. Ceaseless awareness will help those who exert discrimination, too, as arguably, they are often unaware of their own act.

#### The internet 

The creation of awareness does not have to fully depend on close relationships. Email and social media allow safe activity where anonymity is necessary.


## Take-home message

If you have suffered discrimination, or you are a potential target for it, please ensure that you are aware of this plague÷. Regardless of the rank that is lent to types of discrimination such as xenophobia in social agendas (be that fair or wise, or very much otherwise), it must never be tolerated by the people who suffer or witness it. Discrimination breaches human and fundamental rights, national laws and institutional rules.

If you are not a target but you think it is humane to act as an ally against discrimination, please try to confront it if you witness it, and to contribute to a widespread awareness.
