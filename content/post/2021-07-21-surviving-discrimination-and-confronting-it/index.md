There is a lot of discrimination at European universities and in the corresponding academia. Minorities are too often oppressed and abused through the use of casual remarks, concerted attacks, unequal respect towards different groups, and professional negligence as this discrimination is tolerated or condoned by staff of higher authority.


## *Homo homini lupus*

Xenophobia is one of the types of discrimination that sometimes crop up in halls of residence, departments, panels, committees, offices. Xenophobia exists where you are now, as it does where you come from. It is intrinsic to human societies (Hinton, 2017). Who doesn't know the way in which their society tends to rank the different nationalities therein? The locals tend to be first. Through many everyday tricks, the locals often ensure that immigrants remain second to them. The first rank of immigrants is formed of one or two nationalities, perhaps aided by historical or cultural connections. The second rank is that of merely-tolerated immigrants. The third rank is formed of immigrants who are despised due to historical, political, cultural factors. 

Sadly and dangerously enough, in competitive or onerous circumstances (when is that not the case, though!), *homo homini lupus*---that is, discrimination breaks loose (Abbink, & Harris, 2019; Meiring et al., 2014; Mendes & Koslov, 2013). 

Ominous, historical references are unnecessary. A hundred, or a few hundred, years is very little time: it's *yesterday*. 


## Policies

Policy statements are increasingly popular, and they are a reason for hope. For instance, the employment webpage of Duke University reads (on 21st July 2021; https://hr.duke.edu/policies/diversity/eeo):

> Duke University prohibits discrimination and harassment, and provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an individual's age, color, disability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.

Such statements, if indeed observed by the employees, constitute historical---why, historic!---changes. They should be celebrated, applauded---even if they simply adhere to fundamental, human rights.


## Dealing with discrimination

Discrimination takes many forms. Accordingly, surviving and confronting it requires various approaches. Inspiration for such approaches can be found in many places---even in popular literature. For instance, Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* contains a passage in which a lawyer is mobbed by nostalgic townspeople who do not want a Black citizen to be treated as a human. The responses to this mob range from the lawyer's stoicism to his son's adolescent bravery, and from the invisible protection of an armed ally to the disarming ingenuity of the lawyer's daughter. Stoicism, bravery, protection and ingenuity are all good friends against the xenophobia that lurks, and occasionally bites, in halls of residence, informal meetings, committees, offices, and decisions.


### Collection and presentation of evidence

To begin confronting, reporting, and warding off discrimination, it helps to safely store all possible documentary evidence of such discrimination. It is important to ensure the safe collection and storage of the evidence, as sometimes it has to be presented to the relevant mediators or authorities. When that is the case, it is convenient to produce an extensive document that describes in detail every relevant episode and the corresponding evidence, which may be attached. Don't fret about *reading time*: the larger the document, the better.

Name it! Discrimination has precise names---for instance, *xenophobia*---, which must be used where necessary. People know it: perpetrators are likely know its meaning, and so will the authorities or mediators who are in charge of resolving the case. Whether these people like the word to be used or not is their own problem, not yours.


### Ceaseless awareness

Lobbying, whether we like it or not, is one of the necessary ways to confront this plight. So, talk about it. If you are sick and tired of it, make sure that other potential targets of discrimination know that it is not fair; that they should not have to put up with it.

#### The internet 

In addition to an explicit defence from discrimination and the creation of awareness amongst those who are close to us, email and social media offer a possibility of creating defences and awareness. Indeed, the internet is an invaluable platform that can allow safe activity where anonymity is necessary.


## Take-home message

If you have already suffered discrimination, or you are a potential target of it, please ensure that you are aware of this plague, and contribute to a widespread awareness. Regardless of the rank that is lent to types of discrimination such as xenophobia in social agendas (be that fair or wise, or very much otherwise), it must never be tolerated by the people who suffer or witness it. Discrimination breaches human and fundamental rights, national laws and institutional rules.

If you are not a target but you think it is humane to act as an ally against discrimination, please try to confront it if you witness it, and to contribute to a widespread awareness.
