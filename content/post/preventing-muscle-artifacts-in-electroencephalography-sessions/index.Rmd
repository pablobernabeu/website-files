summary: 'In psychological experiments, electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are often contaminated by muscle artifacts, such as blinks and jaw clenching, which generate electrical activity that can obscure the brain signals of interest. These artifacts typically manifest as large, abrupt changes in the EEG signal, complicating data interpretation and analysis. To mitigate these issues, participants can be instructed during the preparatory phase of the session to minimize blinking and to keep their facial muscles relaxed. Additionally, researchers can emphasize the importance of staying still and provide practice sessions to help participants become aware of their movements, thereby reducing the likelihood of muscle artifacts affecting the EEG recordings.'

In psychological experiments, electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are often contaminated by muscle artifacts, such as blinks and jaw clenching, which generate electrical activity that can obscure the brain signals of interest. These artifacts typically manifest as large, abrupt changes in the EEG signal, complicating data interpretation and analysis. To reduce the likelihood of muscle artifacts, participants can be instructed during the preparatory phase of the session to minimize blinking and to keep their facial muscles relaxed. Furthermore, the design of the session can include intervention stages that allow experimenters to verify the quality of the live EEG signal before letting the session continue.


## Participant briefing

## Signal verification stage

Intervention stages allow the experimenters to verify the quality of the live EEG signal before letting the session continue. The following example includes an abbreviated reminder, <span style = 'color: #B47DB6; background-color: orange;'>&nbsp;i.s.r </span>, prompting the experimenter to verify the **i**mpedance and the **s**ignal before starting to **r**ecord the signal.

Having completed these tasks, the experimenter presses the keys---unbeknownst to participants---that are needed to let the session continue. The screenshot below shows an example setup in OpenSesame, whereby the letter <kbd>C</kbd> must be pressed twice to advance. The orange stripes flag up the need for the experimenter to intervene.

And repeat the message. It helps.

## Outcome

The combination of verbal and written instructions, along with signal verification stages, helps obtain much cleaner EEG data, helping preserve more data in the [preprocessing](/2020/event-related-potentials-why-and-how-i-used-them/#preprocessing-erps).
