*Fluke* is a popular term for the statistical concepts of false positive or false negative results (more commonly used for false positives). A *false positive* occurs when a result that does not exist in reality is observed in an analysis due to a methodological error (be it experimental, statistical, or otherwise). Conversely, a *false negative* occurs when a genuine result is not observed in an analysis, due to the same kind of error. The concept of fluke is defined by its opposite: a truthful, accurate result.

The label 'fluke' is ubiquitous where statistics is applied, from medicine to psychology and from sociology to politics.

## What's in the label 'fluke'?

AOC's tweet points at two main types of reactions to her results in the previous elections. The first type is dismissal, on the grounds of a fluke or a weak opposition. The other reaction is plain 'aberration'. So, around the statistical underpinning of 'fluke' lurks the shadow of bias. We may then have to ask: Why is a certain result perceived as a fluke? Could such a perception ever be influenced by the biases that pervade human thought? Ultimately, what are the consequences of labeling a result as a fluke?

From perceptual to cognitive and historical biases, people's judgements  are susceptible to visual mistakes (Zamboni, Ledgeway, McGraw, & Schluppeck, 2016), confirmation bias (Rajsic, Taylor, & Pratt, 2018), and biased records (Hug, 2003).

In summary, some of the ingredients that a *fluke* label is apt to contain are:
