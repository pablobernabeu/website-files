summary: Reducing the impedance in electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for capturing high-quality brain activity signals. This process involves ensuring that electrodes make optimal contact with the scalp without harming the participant. Below are a few tips to achieve this using a blunt needle, electrolyte gel and gentle wiggling.

<h2>First, Do No Harm</h2>
<p>The primary goal is to reduce the impedance without damaging the skin or causing discomfort. Only use blunt needles and never let the needle pierce the skin. While wiggling under each electrode, do not any apply any force down on the skin. To achieve this, hold the syringe with the minimum grip force needed to hold it in place.</p>
</div>
<div id="manage-the-angle-of-the-needle" class="section level2">
<h2>Manage the Angle of the Needle</h2>
<p>The needle should be positioned at an angle of around 20–50 degrees relative to the participant’s scalp/skin.</p>
</div>
<div id="manage-the-depth-of-the-needle" class="section level2">
<h2>Manage the Depth of the Needle</h2>
<p>Be cautious about the depth of the needle. The goal is to make contact with the skin but not scratch it. Gently wiggle the needle to maximize electrode contact with the skin, which helps lower the impedance.</p>
</div>
<div id="apply-gel-strategically" class="section level2">
<h2>Apply Gel Strategically</h2>
<p>Use just enough electrolyte gel to reduce the impedance, but avoid creating bridges between adjacent electrodes. A small amount of gel should be visible on the opening of each electrode, and any large lumps should be carefully removed. This ensures that each electrode maintains a distinct connection with the scalp.</p>
</div>
<div id="control-the-swing-of-the-electrode" class="section level2">
<h2>Control the Swing of the Electrode</h2>
<p>Place your finger on the electrode throughout the wiggling to feel and control its movement. This helps prevent excess gel from forming a bump under the electrode, which could lead to inaccurate readings.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiggle-with-precision" class="section level2">
<h2>Wiggle with Precision</h2>
<p>Wiggle the electrode in small circular motions to move hair aside and ensure good scalp contact. Be careful not to scratch the scalp in the process. Position yourself comfortably to access each electrode, allowing for precise movements and minimising participant discomfort.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you’ll achieve lower impedance without causing harm, ensuring high-quality EEG data and a better experience for the participant.</p>
