<p>When knitting an R Markdown document after the first time, errors may sometimes appear. Three tips are recommended below.</p>
<div id="close-pdf-reader-window" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Close PDF reader window</h2>
<p>When the document is knitted through the ‘Knit’ button, a PDF reader window opens to present the result. Closing this window can help resolve errors.</p>
</div>
<div id="delete-service-files" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Delete service files</h2>
<p>Every time the Rmd is knitted, some service files are created. Some of these files have the ‘.tex’ extension (e.g., index.tex, Appendix-B.tex), whereas others do not (e.g., index.log, ZHJhZnQtYXBhLlJtZA==.Rmd, index.synctex.gz). Deleting these files can help resolve errors (see a <a href="/2021/avoiding-knitting-errors-in-r-markdown-using-knit-deleting-service-files/">possible function</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="delete-code-chunks-related-to-the-appendices" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Delete code chunks related to the appendices</h2>
<p>When knitting <a href="https://github.com/crsh/papaja">papaja</a> documents containing any appendices, some code chunks related to the appendices will automatically appear at the end of the primary Rmd file—e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>```{r echo = FALSE, results = &#39;asis&#39;, cache = FALSE}
papaja::render_appendix(&#39;Appendix-A.Rmd&#39;)
```</code></pre>
<p>Normally, these code chunks are automatically removed as the knitting finishes. However, if the chunks remain in place, deleting them manually can help resolve errors.</p>
</div>
