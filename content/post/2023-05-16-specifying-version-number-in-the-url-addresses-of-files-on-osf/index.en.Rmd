In the preparation of projects, files are often downloaded from OSF. It is good to provide the URL addresses used for the downloads, and it's even better to add the version of the file to the URL. This specification helps reduce the possibility of inaccuracies later, should the file be modified. The version can be specified by adding `?version=`**X** to the download link. For instance, the seventh version is specified in the link [https://osf.io/hx6tz/download`?version=7`](https://osf.io/hx6tz/download?version=7).
