<p>In the preparation of projects, files are often downloaded from OSF. It is good to provide the URL addresses used for the downloads, and it’s even better to add the version of the file to the URL. Specifying the version limits the possibility of inaccuracies later, in case the file is modified after the fact. The version can be specified by adding <code>?version=</code><strong>X</strong> to the download link. For instance, the seventh version of the file is specified in the link <a href="https://osf.io/hx6tz/download?version=7">https://osf.io/hx6tz/download<code>?version=7</code></a>.</p>
