summary: "Unwanted, stranded meetings, overlapping with a general one in a channel, can occur when people click on the <kbd>Meet now</kbd>/:camera: button, instead of clicking on the same ‘Join’ link in the chat field. This may especially happen to those who reach the channel first, or who cannot see the ‘Join’ link in the chat field because this field has been taken up by messages."

Unwanted, stranded meetings, overlapping with a general one in a channel, can occur when people click on the <kbd>Meet now</kbd>/:camera: button, instead of clicking on the same ‘Join’ link in the chat field. This may especially happen to those who reach the channel first, or who cannot see the ‘Join’ link in the chat field because this field has been taken up by messages.

To prevent students from creating or joining stray meetings, the channel lead can direct students to a single meeting link in the chat field, which could be upward ion this field, and to avoid the <kbd>Meet now</kbd>/:camera: button at the top right in channels.
