summary: "Unwanted, stranded meetings, overlapping with a general one in a channel, can occur when people click on the <kbd>Meet (now)</kbd>/:camera: button, instead of clicking on the same <kbd>Join</kbd> button in the chat field. This may especially happen to those who reach the channel first, or who cannot see the <kbd>Join</kbd> button in the chat field because this field has been taken up by messages."

Unwanted, stranded meetings, overlapping with a general one in a channel, can occur when people click on the <kbd>Meet (now)</kbd>/:camera: button, instead of clicking on the same <kbd>Join</kbd> button in the chat field. This may especially happen to those who reach the channel first, or who cannot see the <kbd>Join</kbd> button in the chat field because this field has been taken up by messages.

To prevent students from creating or joining stray meetings, the channel lead can direct students to a single meeting link in the chat field, which could be upward ion this field, and to avoid the <kbd>Meet (now)</kbd>/:camera: button at the top right in channels.
