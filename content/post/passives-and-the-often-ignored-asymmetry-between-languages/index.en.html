<p>Given all of the data that E&amp;L [Evans and Levinson] cite, how could anyone maintain the notion of a universal grammar with linguistic content? Traditionally, there have been three basic strategies. First, just as we may force English grammar into the Procrustean bed of Latin grammar – that is how I was taught the structure of English in grade school – the grammars of the world’s so-called exotic languages may be forced into an abstract scheme based mainly on European languages.</p>

<p>Researchers often make participants jump through hoops. Due to our personal blind spots, it seems easier to realise the full extent of these acrobatics when we consider the work of other researchers. In linguistic research, the acrobatics are often spurred by unnatural grammatical constructions. For instance, in Spanish, <em>be</em>-based passive constructions—such as <em>La guerra fue empezada por …</em> ‘The war was started by …’—are much less frequent than in English. In Spanish, <em>be</em>-passives are mostly reserved for the formal, written discourse. Beyond that realm, two alternative constructions take preference. One hinges on the reflexive pronoun <em>se</em>—e.g., <em>El apartamento se vendió</em> ‘The apartment was sold’ (Takagaki, 2005). Another construction implements a pronominal object clitic in preverbal position.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The latter periphrastic construction, though not strictly passive, is thematically equivalent to many passives in English.</p>

<p>The ratio of 5 to 5,300 results clearly suggests that <em>be</em>-passives are much less common than the periphrastic construction implementing a preverbal clitic. In the light of this ratio, it is surprising to find linguistic research that seems overlook the asymmetry between English and Spanish regarding passives. For instance, in a study on cross-linguistic syntactic priming in bilingual children, Vasilyeva et al. (2010) used stimuli such as <em>El gato fue lavado por el perro</em> ‘The cat was washed by the dog’. Through a quick-and-dirty corpus analysis using a search engine, we can examine the limitations of these stimuli. Whereas the English form ‘The cat was washed’ is common enough, the literal translations <em>El gato fue lavado</em> and <em>La gata fue lavada</em> are essentially negligible.</p>

<p>Vasilyeva et al. (2010) observed that, when primed with English-like, be-based passives in Spanish, the children increased their use of passive constructions in English. In contrast, exposure to English passives in the prime sentences did not lead to a greater use of the English-like passives in Spanish. The authors described this contrast as an <em>asymmetry</em>, which has been profusely echoed in the subsequent literature (Serratrice, 2022). The caveat about this finding is that the stimuli <em>themselves</em> contain an asymmetry, as the <em>be</em>-passive is negligible in Spanish, at least compared to English, and especially among children.</p>
<p>This seems a good opportunity to reflect on the asymmetries that exist across languages, and on the need to account for those in the creation of stimuli for linguistic studies.</p>
