<p>I recommend caution when receiving an invitation from Polar Insight (also dubbed ‘Polar Intelligence’) to complete a survey. When I received one, it ended up in a deceptive change of the terms. The deception emerged after two emails exchanged with the company’s managing director, James Tattersfield, and an employee.</p>
<p>The case began when the managing director invited me to complete two tasks in exchange for a $125 USD voucher. The two tasks were a survey (‘short form’, in the director’s words) and an hour-long interview. Below is the email:</p>

<p>Hi Pablo,</p>
<p>I’m emailing you to discuss your participation in a global research study that my organisation (Polar Insight, a research firm based in London) is conducting to better understand how academic researchers are discovering and accessing scholarly articles outside university campus.</p>

<p>My research team has identified you as a potential respondent and asked me to reach out to see whether you may be interested in taking part in one of our online, paid research interviews in February. Does this sound like something you would be interested in?</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>Format: Online Video Interview
Time required: 60 minutes
When: February 2022
Prep. required: None
Reward for taking part: $125 USD (via our gifting partner, Tremendous)</p>

<p>Following this invitation, I—and presumably many other researchers—responded to a survey (see some screenshots below) that provided the company with data that might be used for business purposes.</p>

<p><img src="images/Capture2.PNG" width="500" /></p>
<p><img src="images/Capture3.PNG" width="500" /></p>

<p><img src="images/Capture8.PNG" width="500" /></p>
<p><img src="images/Capture9.PNG" width="500" /></p>
<p>Once the company had received my survey completed, an employee wrote back to change the original terms, on the grounds that ‘we have had a high volume of responses to our survey, so unfortunately, not everyone will be selected on this occasion’. Such a change of the terms was unethical, as it happened after I had accepted the invitation from the company under the original terms. Crucially, if the company had truthfully specified the terms in the first email, they would not have received back anywhere as many surveys completed. Ethics is important in the distribution of surveys, even in business.</p>
<p>The present case incidentally demonstrates that the role of ethics committees—tasked with assessing surveys, among other things—goes beyond gross themes. Economic deception is one of the negligent acts that must be prevented.</p>
