Many Romance languages allow the movement of pronominal object clitics to the preverbal position (Hanson & Carlson, 2014; Labotka et al., 2023). That is, instead of saying *La maestra lo ha detto* (Italian) 'The teacher has said it', it is possible to say *Lo ha detto la maestra* 'It has said the teacher'. The latter is a marked phrasing that increases the attention to the subject of the sentence. While English syntax does not allow this movement of the clitic, the marked sentence could be translated as 'The teacher has said it herself' or "It's the teacher that has said it". How does Google Translate (GT) deal with this in May 2023? For this specific case, GT opts for 'The teacher said', which is a good, idiomatic option. When it comes to translating to Spanish, GT returns 'El profesor dijo', which is the direct equivalent of the English translation. This option is valid in some varieties of Spanish in America. Nonetheless, it must be noted that a more direct translation from the Italian form would have been very good.

GT has a greater trouble when the content of the sentence is slightly less frequent. For instance, *Lo cerca la maestra* 'Him is seeking the teacher' is stripped of its markedness in GT's rendering in English---i.e., 'The teacher is looking for him'. The alternative option, to preserving the focus on the subject---e.g., "It's the teacher that's looking for him"---would require some syntactic liberties, and hence entail some risks. So, playing it safe is understandable. Our next step is checking the translation to some Romance languages that allow the same movement to preverbal position present in the original Italian sentence *Lo cerca la maestra*. Aside from GT, the sentence could be well translated into Romanian as *Îl caută dăscăliţa*, or into Spanish as *Lo busca la profesora*. In contrast, for both translations, GT returns the equivalents of the English translation---i.e., *Profesorul îl caută* and *El profesor lo busca*, again discarding the focus on the subject---unnecessarily in these cases, due to the overlap in the grammars.^[There are also errors of gender in the translations of *la maestra*.]

In fairness, machine translation is an absolute feat overall, provided it's used with enough caution. It's only going to improve with the expansion of language models. So, how much of a piece of cake will it be for GT to crack some of these syntactic details in time, and to preserve syntactic forms when the systems of both languages are alike?
