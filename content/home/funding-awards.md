| 2026 | Pump priming grant, [John Fell Fund, Oxford University Press](https://www.socsci.ox.ac.uk/john-fell-oup-research-fund) | Grounded in a complex dynamic systems framework, our approach conceptualises reading not as a simple outcome, but as an emergent property of the interactions between a text’s demands and a reader’s diverse knowledge base. Thus, the project will investigate how specific, computationally-derived text features—e.g., word frequency, concreteness, semantic coherence, lexical and syntactic complexity, and sentiment—interact with key individual differences in children’s skills and their family context. |
