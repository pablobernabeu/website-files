Since my PhD, I have advised several students and colleagues about conducting behavioural and EEG experiments, and about data processing and statistics. Furthermore, during my postdoc, I have co-supervised a master's thesis. 

My PhD scholarship was teaching-based, so I contributed to my department’s curriculum for 180 hours a year. Each year, I led 30 seminars and marked 80 essays in developmental, cognitive and social psychology, while also helping in 30 statistics labs. This activity is detailed below.

Furthermore, during my PhD, I was a representative for graduate teaching assistants in my department for a year.

Last, I am a [Certified Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor), and have led several [workshops on data analysis using R](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/#workshops). Earlier in my career, I [taught English to secondary-education students in Spain](/#other-work), and [Spanish to adults in Lithuania](/#BA-degree).
