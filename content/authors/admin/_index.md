As the local manager of the [**LESS Project** (Language Economy through Transfer Source Selectivity)](https://app.cristin.no/projects/show.jsf?id=2559611), I worked on a longitudinal study that investigates how bilingual people acquire an additional language, how this process is influenced by the characteristics of the languages, and how the process is instantiated in the brain. As part of this work, I contributed to designing our main study and developing materials in Norwegian and English, as well as creating materials in Spanish and English for a partner study in Spain. After documenting and pretesting these materials, I prepared a [preregistration](https://osf.io/tjr54) for the studies. Additionally, I recruited participants, designed the protocol for electroencephalography (EEG) sessions, and trained students and research assistants in both the protocol and EEG methodology more broadly. I also established and managed an EEG lab, conducted numerous sessions, supervised those led by research assistants, and monitored the longitudinal progress per participant. Moreover, I presented the study design at conferences and collaborated with research assistants to preprocess, visualise and analyse EEG and behavioural data.'

Consistent with a large body of research, I observed that conceptual processing is not restricted to abstract linguistic representations, but is modulated by the perceptual information in words and by people&#39;s individual experiences in perceptual domains. Outside of my thesis, I investigated the influence of specific languages in nonverbal cognition. Specifically, I reviewed research examining how and why people&#39;s perception of motion may be modulated by the way in which their first language encodes motion events in sentences. Furthermore, I investigated the co-evolution of language and other cognitive systems. Throughout this research, I used a range of multidisciplinary methods including word classification surveys, corpus analysis and electroencephalography.'

I conduct research and data analysis on digitally-enhanced childhood learning as part of the [Learning in Families through Technology (LiFT) project](https://www.education.ox.ac.uk/project/lift-learning-in-families-through-technology) at the Department of Education at the University of Oxford.

Previously, I held a postdoctoral fellowship at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, contributing to a project on language learning, crosslinguistic influence and executive functions. Prior to that, I completed a PhD in Psychology at Lancaster University, having previously earned a research master’s in Language and Communication from Tilburg University.

Beyond education and digital technologies, my interests include cognitive psychology and neuroscience, linguistics, digital technologies, data science, research methods and open science.

I have worked with a wide range of research methods, including behavioural and EEG experiments, corpus analysis and computational modelling.

Materials from my research are available at [osf.io/25u3x](https://osf.io/25u3x).
