abstract: 'This web application is suitable for educational and research contexts in the experimental sciences. It allows the creation of varied data sets with specified characteristics, such as between-group or within-participant variables, that can in turn be categorical or continuous. Each of these characteristics can be selected along the different tabs. In the penultimate tab, a custom summary of the current data set can be constructed. In the last tab, the list of parameters and the data set can be downloaded.'

This web application is suitable for educational and research contexts in the experimental sciences. It allows the creation of varied data sets with specified characteristics, such as between-group or within-participant variables, that can in turn be categorical or continuous. Each of these characteristics can be selected along the different tabs. In the penultimate tab, a custom summary of the current data set can be constructed. In the last tab, the list of parameters and the data set can be downloaded.

### Citing this app

Bernabeu, P., & Lynott, D. (2020). Experiment simulation app (Version `r read.delim('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablobernabeu/Experimental-data-simulation/master/version_number', header = FALSE)[1,1] %>% cat()   # update version number at https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Experimental-data-simulation/blob/master/version_number`) [Web application]. [https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Experiment-simulation-app/](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Experiment-simulation-app/){target='_blank'}.

### Code

This web application was developed in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html){target='_blank'} (R Core Team, 2020). The code is [available on Github](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Experiment-simulation-app/blob/master/experiment-simulation.Rmd){target='_blank'}, where contributions may be made. The initial code for this application was influenced by Section 5.7 in Crump (2017; [*Simulating data for multi-factor designs*](https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/simulating-and-analyzing-data-in-r.html#simulating-data-for-multi-factor-designs){target='_blank'}). The R packages used included shiny (Chang, Cheng, Allaire, Xie, & McPherson, 2020) and Tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019).
