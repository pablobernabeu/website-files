### Purposes

This web application is suitable for education or research purposes in experimental sciences. It allows the **creation of varied data sets with specified elements, such as between-group or within-participant variables, that can be categorical or continuous.** These features can be selected inside the different tabs. In the penultimate tab, a custom summary of the current data set can be constructed. In the last tab, the list of parameters and the data set can be downloaded.

### Code

This web application was developed in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) (R Core Team, 2020). The code is [available on Github](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Experiment-simulation-app/blob/master/experiment-simulation.Rmd), where contributions may be made. The initial code for this application was influenced by Section 5.7 in Crump (2017; [*Simulating data for multi-factor designs*](https://crumplab.github.io/programmingforpsych/simulating-and-analyzing-data-in-r.html#simulating-data-for-multi-factor-designs)). The R packages used include Shiny (Chang, Cheng, Allaire, Xie, & McPherson, 2020) and Tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019).
